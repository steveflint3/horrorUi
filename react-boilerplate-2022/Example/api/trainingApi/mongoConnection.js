// Mongo and api are containerized inside of the same docker network.  Since this
// api is in the same network as mongo, you can use the mongo container name (mongo)
// as the host in the connection string below.  To connect to mongo from outside of docker
// container, use localhost for host.  Mongo is started inside of container on port
// 27017 and it is mapped to port 27031 on the host machine.  So, to connect to mongo from inside
// of the container network, as we do here, you use port 27017. To connect to mongo
// from host machine outside of the container network, use 27031.
// - connection url from inside container => mongodb://mongo:27017/movies
// - connection url from outside container => mongodb://localhost:27031/movies
